# gw2bot-site

The website of [GW2Bot](https://github.com/Maselkov/GW2Bot), created by [Maselkov](https://github.com/Maselkov/).
Visit [gw2bot.info](https://gw2bot.info/) to see the live website.

## About

This website is built using [Nuxt.js](https://v2.nuxt.com/) and takes advantage of an embedded [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) API.

It showcases some features of the bot, lists the available commands, and hosts a couple of FAQs.

It also has Discord authentication for viewing encounter logs that are uploaded via the bot.

## Setup

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally for development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
# Start production server
npm run start
```

### Nuxt configuration

You must replace `YOUR_BOT_ID` in the file `./nuxt.config.js` with your Discord bot's Client ID for authentication.

``` js
// ./nuxt.config.js

export default {
  auth: {
    strategies: {
      discord: {
        client_id: 'YOUR_BOT_ID'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Discord bot configuration

You must configure the OAuth2 redirect URIs for your bot to allow Discord authentication. Go to your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and select your bot. Go to OAuth2 General settings and enter the following URIs:

Development: `http://localhost:3000/login`

Production: `https://gw2bot.info/login`

### MongoDB configuration

In development, make sure your local mongodb service is running when you try to view the logs page. The website connects to the same database used by GW2Bot.

If your connection to the database times out, you may need to edit your [mongod configuration file](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/configuration-options/#configuration-file-options) to enable IPV6 connection to localhost:

``` yaml
# path/to/mongod.cfg

net:
  port: 27017
  bindIp: localhost,127.0.0.1
  ipv6: true
```

#### Encounter Details

The website will set a `details` field for each database entry in the `gw2.encounters` collection of the `toothy` database when a user visits the `/logs` page to view their encounter logs. The `details` object contains extra data about each encounter and is fetched from `dps.report` on the client-side, then sent to the server via POST request. The data is validated before being saved to the database.

In the event that you need to reset the details field of every encounter in the database, use the [updateMany](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateMany/) method via [mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell):

``` shell
# Connect to the database via mongosh
mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017"

# Switch to the toothy database
use toothy

# Delete the "details" field of every encounter in the database
db.getCollection("gw2.encounters").updateMany({}, { $unset: { details: true }})
```
